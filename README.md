# Machine-Learning-Experiments

The repo consists of .ipynb files for basics of Machine learning.
It implements a few basic libraries of Machine Learning like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib 
and then implements algorithms from Sklearn i.e Linear and Logistic Regression, Classification algorithms like SVM and KNN Classifier.

The link to all the datasets that are used to implement are provided in the .ipynb files itself.
